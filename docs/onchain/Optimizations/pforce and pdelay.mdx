# `pforce` and `pdelay`

`plet` and `phoist` are the two main tools to use when focusing on optimizations; 

this is because they significantly reduce both script size and cost of execution.

`pforce` and `pdelay` do slightly increase the size of a script but when used properly they can save you quite a bit on execution costs.

As we know, `plu-ts` is strictly evaluated, meaning that arguments are evaluated before being passed to a function.

We can opt out of this behaviour using `pdelay` which wraps a term of any type in a `delayed` type so a term of type `int` becomes `delayed( int )` if passed to `pdelay`. A `delayed` type can be unwrapped only using `pforce`; that finally executes the term.

There are two main reasons for why we would want to do this:

- delaying the execution of some term we might not need at all
- prevent to raise unwanted errors

One example of the use of `pforce` and `pdelay` is the `pif` function.

In fact, the base _if then else_ function is `pstrictIf`, however when we use an _if then else_ statement we only need one of the two arguments to be actually evaluated.

So when we call `pif`, it is just as if we were doing something like:

```ts
pforce(
    pstrictIf( delayed( returnType ) )
    .$( myCondtion )
    .$(
        pdelay( caseTrue )
    )
    .$(
        pdelay( caseFalse )
    )
)
```

so that we only evaluate what we need.

Not only that, but if one of the two branches throws an error but we don't need it, everything goes through smoothly:

```ts
pforce(
    pstrictIf( delayed( int ) )
    .$( true )
    .$(
        pdelay( pInt( 42 ) )
    )
    .$(
        pdelay( perror( int ) )
    )
)
```
Here, everything is ok. If instead we just used the plain `pstrictIf`

```ts
    pstrictIf( int )
    .$( pBool( true ) )
    .$( pInt( 42 ) )
    // highlight-error
    .$( perror( int ) ) // KABOOM !!!
```
this results in an error, because the error is evaluated _before_ being passed as argument.
