# Hello plu-ts

Write a smart contract in 5 minutes; deploy it in 10. Enjoy it forever.

## Pre-requisites

To build a Smart contract and interact with it all we need is `plu-ts` and some way to submit transactions.

Infact, `plu-ts` allows you to write the smart contract and create transactions.

To submit the tranasction we will use the [koios](https://www.koios.rest/) API, with a simple POST request to the [submit endpoint](https://api.koios.rest/#post-/submittx);
but we'll think about that later.

So our pre-requisites add up to:

- `plu-ts` (and `npm` to install it)
- anything that can run javascript (server environment or browser, doesn't matter)
- an internet connection

## Project set up

usign `git` we clone a very simple template project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts-starter.git
mv plu-ts-starter hello-pluts
cd hello-pluts
```

this gives us a simple project structure:
```
./hello-pluts
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── contract.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── MyDatum
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── MyRedeemer
│       └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

Now we only need to run `npm install` to automatically add the `plu-ts` library.
```
npm install
```

_et voilà_ we are ready to start!

## The contract

### Template overview

If we now navigate to `src/contract.ts` we see we have a very simple validator already!

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
import { Address, bool, compile, makeValidator, PaymentCredentials, pBool, pfn, Script, ScriptType, V2 } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts";
import MyDatum from "./MyDatum";
import MyRedeemer from "./MyRedeemer";

// highlight-start

export const contract = pfn([
    MyDatum.type,
    MyRedeemer.type,
    V2.PScriptContext.type
],  bool)
(( datum, redeemer, ctx ) =>
    // always suceeds
    pBool( true )
);

// highlight-end

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// ------------------------------------------------------------- //
// ------------------------- utilities ------------------------- //
// ------------------------------------------------------------- //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

export const untypedValidator = makeValidator( contract );

export const compiledContract = compile( untypedValidator );

export const script = new Script(
    ScriptType.PlutusV2,
    compiledContract
);

export const scriptMainnetAddr = new Address(
    "mainnet",
    new PaymentCredentials(
        "script",
        script.hash
    )
);

export const scriptTestnetAddr = new Address(
    "testnet",
    new PaymentCredentials(
        "script",
        script.hash.clone()
    )
);

export default contract;
```

Let's focus only on the contract for now;

this contract expects a `MyDatum`, a `MyRedeemer` and finally a `PScriptContext` to validate a transaction.

`MyDatum` and `MyRedeemer` are types defined by us respectively in `src/MyDatum/index.ts` and `src/MyRedeemer/index.ts`

```ts title="src/MyDatum/index.ts"
import { int, pstruct } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts";

// modify the Datum as you prefer
const MyDatum = pstruct({
    Num: {
        number: int
    },
    NoDatum: {}
});

export default MyDatum;
```

```ts title="src/MyRedeemer/index.ts"
import { pstruct } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts";

// modify the Redeemer as you prefer
const MyRedeemer = pstruct({
    Option1: {},
    Option2: {}
});

export default MyRedeemer;
```

whereas `PScriptContex` is a predefined data structure that is passed by the `cardano-node` itself that will run our smart contract.

finally, the contract is used in `src/index.ts` which is our entry point.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { script } from "./contract";

console.log("validator compiled succesfully! 🎉\n");
console.log(
    JSON.stringify(
        script.toJson(),
        undefined,
        2
    )
);
```

the index just imports `script` from `src/contract.ts` adn prints it out in the json form.

if we go back to `src/contract.ts` we see that the script is obtained using the following steps:

1) adapting the validator to the standard using `makeValidator`

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
/* ... */
// highlight-start

export const untypedValidator = makeValidator( contract );

// highlight-end
export const compiledContract = compile( untypedValidator );

export const script = new Script(
    ScriptType.PlutusV2,
    compiledContract
);

/* ... */
```

2) compiling the validator with `compile`

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
/* ... */

export const untypedValidator = makeValidator( contract );
// highlight-start

export const compiledContract = compile( untypedValidator );

// highlight-end
export const script = new Script(
    ScriptType.PlutusV2,
    compiledContract
);

/* ... */
```
3) wrapping it in a `Script` that can be used offchain

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
/* ... */

export const untypedValidator = makeValidator( contract );

export const compiledContract = compile( untypedValidator );
// highlight-start

export const script = new Script(
    ScriptType.PlutusV2,
    compiledContract
);

// highlight-end
/* ... */
```

that is all we need for now.

### run the template

If we did every step of above correctly we should be able to run
```bash
npm run start
```

and the output should look like:
```
validator compiled succesfully! 🎉

{
  "type": "PlutusScriptV2",
  "description": "",
  "cborHex": "56550100002225333573466644494400c0080045261601"
}
```

Well congratulations 🥳!

this is your first compiled smart contract 🎉!

But we won't stop here for sure!

Let's personalize this smart contract.

## Hello plu-ts

We want to personalize the smart contract so that:

- it suceeds if the transaction is signed by us.
- and we are being polite by saluting the contract.

### introduce an `owner`

To make sure the transaction is signed by us we'll keep track of an `owner` in the datum (the first argument we saw in the contract).

:::info datum

The datum helps us keep track of the history of the input the smart contract is validating.

:::

Currently our datum is a struct, but it could be really anything;

and all we need to keep track of an owner is just a public key hash.

so in `src/contract.ts` we'll change `MyDatum` to `PPubKeyHash`:

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
import { Address, bool, compile, makeValidator, PaymentCredentials, pBool, pfn, Script, ScriptType, V2 } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts";
import MyDatum from "./MyDatum";
import MyRedeemer from "./MyRedeemer";

const contract = pfn([
    // highlight-next-line
    PPubKeyHash.type,
    MyRedeemer.type,
    V2.PScriptContext.type
],  bool)
// highlight-next-line
// we should also change the name of the variable here
// highlight-next-line
// from `datum` to `owner`
// highlight-next-line
(( owner, redeemer, ctx ) =>
    // always suceeds
    pBool( true )
);

/* ... */
```

### send messages to the contracts

The second condtion requires us to send some message to the contract.

This is done thanks to the redeemer (or the second argument of a validator).

:::info redeemer

The redeemer is the argument specified by the user that interacts with the smart contract

:::

once again, all we need in order to have a message is just a `bytestring`, nothing more complex,

so we'll change `MyRedeemer` to the primitive type `bs`

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
import { Address, bool, compile, makeValidator, PaymentCredentials, pBool, pfn, Script, ScriptType, V2 } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts";
import MyDatum from "./MyDatum";
import MyRedeemer from "./MyRedeemer";

const contract = pfn([
    PPubKeyHash.type,
    // highlight-next-line
    bs,
    V2.PScriptContext.type
],  bool)
// highlight-next-line
// we should also change the name of the variable here
// highlight-next-line
// from `redeemer` to `message`
// highlight-next-line
(( owner, message, ctx ) =>
    // always suceeds
    pBool( true )
);

/* ... */
```

### implement the logic

finally we'll check both the conditions in the body of the function.

so we'll first create a term that checks that the message is the one expected:

```ts
const isBeingPolite = message.eq("Hello plu-ts");
```

then we'll check that the transaction is signed by the owner specified in the datum.

to do so we need informations about the tranasaction and who signed it.

That information is passed by the `cardano-node` trough the `PScriptContext`.

we can access it as follows:
```ts
const signers =
    // extract informations on the transaciton
    ctx.extract("txInfo").in( ({ txInfo }) =>
    // extract the reqired signers of the transactions
    txInfo.extract("signatories").in( ({ signatories }) =>
        // return the signers
        signatories
    ));
```

and finally check that the owner as indeed signed the transaction:
```ts
const signedByOwner = signers.some( signer => signer.eq( owner ) );
```

and finally, we put all together

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
import { Address, bool, compile, makeValidator, PaymentCredentials, pBool, pfn, Script, ScriptType, V2 } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts";
import MyDatum from "./MyDatum";
import MyRedeemer from "./MyRedeemer";

const contract = pfn([
    PPubKeyHash.type,
    bs,
    V2.PScriptContext.type
],  bool)
(( owner, message, ctx ) => {

    const isBeingPolite = message.eq("Hello plu-ts");

    const signers =
        // extract informations on the transaciton
        ctx.extract("txInfo").in( ({ txInfo }) =>
        // extract the reqired signers of the transactions
        txInfo.extract("signatories").in( ({ signatories }) =>
            // return the signers
            signatories
        ));

    const signedByOwner = signers.some( signer => signer.eq( owner ) );

    return isBeingPolite.and( signedByOwner );
});

/* ... */

```

now runing the program with `npm run start` gives us back:
```
validator compiled succesfully! 🎉

{
  "type": "PlutusScriptV2",
  "description": "",
  "cborHex": "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"
}
```

We did it! We wrote our first contract!

## Deployng the Contract

now that we have our personal contract we'll use [Koios] to help us with the offchain.

for better integration we can install the `koios-pluts` package so that we can make requests to koios and have actual plu-ts values.
```bash
npm install @hamroniclabs/koios-pluts
```

eventually we'll also need some help with binary data
```bash
npm install @hamroniclabs/uint8array-utils
```

then to keep the project clean we'll create a new `offchain` folder, under `src`

```bash
mkdir src/offchain
```

### create the Koios provider

To make sure we do all our requests in testnet `koios-pluts` exposes teh utility class `KoiosProvoder` which will remember the network we are operating in for us.

let's build an instance:
```ts title="src/offchain/koios.ts"
import { KoiosProvider } from "@harmoniclabs/koios-pluts"

export const koios = new KoiosProvider("testnet");

export default koios;
```

### create the transaction builder

To build a `TxBuilder` we'll need to fetch the current protocol parameters, that is an asyncronous operation;

so we'll write an asnyc function that constructs our transaction builder:

```ts title="src/offchain/getTxBuilder.ts"
import { koios } from "./koios"

/**
 * we don't want to do too many API call if we already have our `txBuilder`
 * 
 * so after the first call we'll store a copy here.
**/
let _cachedTxBuilder: TxBuilder | undefined = undefined

export default async function getTxBuilder(): TxBuilder
{
    if(!( _cachedTxBuilder instanceof TxBuilder ))
    _cachedTxBuilder = new TxBuilder(
        "testnet",
        await koios.epoch.protocolParams() // defaults to current epoch
    );

    return _cachedTxBuilder;
)
```

### get some founds

You can use the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet).

:::info preprod

Just be sure to select the **Preprod** testnet.

:::

:::caution return the test ADA

once you finish with your tADA make sure to return them to the faucet.

tADA have no real world value but are still limited, and onther developers will need them!

to return tADA to the faucet just send them to the following testnet address:

`addr_test1qqr585tvlc7ylnqvz8pyqwauzrdu0mxag3m7q56grgmgu7sxu2hyfhlkwuxupa9d5085eunq2qywy7hvmvej456flknswgndm3`

:::

### build the deploy transaciton

now that we have received our `tADA` we can start playng.

Firs we need to access them in our code.

We can do so by querying the utxos at the address you received the tADA to.

since we'll query our utxos some times we make an utility function for that.

```ts title="src/offchain/queryMyUtxos.ts"
import type { UTxO } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts"
import { koios } from "./koios";

export default async function queryMyUtxos(): Promise<UTxO[]>
{
    return await koios.address.utxos( "<paste your tesnet address here>" )
)
```

now that we can access our utxos we can finally start building transactions.

The first transaction we want to do is to deploy the smart contract and found it.


Let's check we got everything:

- [x] smart contract
- [x] `TxBuilder`
- [x] A way to comunicate with the blockchain

yes, we can go!

```ts title="src/offchain/getDeployAndFoundTx.ts"
import { Address, PaymentCredentials, Value, DataB } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts"
import { scriptTestnetAddr } from "../contract";
import getTxBuilder from "./getTxBuilder";
import queryMyUtxos from "./queryMyUtxos";


export default async function getDeployAndFoundTx( script: Script ): Promise<Tx>
{
    const txBuilder = await getTxBuilder();
    const myUTxOs = await queryMyUtxos();

    return txBuilder.buildSync({
        inputs: [{ utxo: myUTxOs[0] }],
        outputs: [
            { // output which holds the reference script
                address: scriptTestnetAddr,
                value: Value.lovelaces( 10_000_000 ),
                // an utxo with no datum that sits 
                // that a script address (like in this case)
                // is locked FOREVER
                // this way no one will be able to "un-deploy" our smart contract
                datum: undefined,
                refScript: script
            },
            { // output holding the founds that we'll spend later
                address: scriptTestnetAddr,
                value: Value.lovelaces( 10_000_000 ),
                // remeber to include a datum
                datum: new DataB(
                    // remember we set the datum to be the public key hash?
                    // we can extract it from the address as follows
                    Address.fromString( "<paste your address here>" )
                    .paymentCreds.hash
                )
            }
        ],
        // send everything left back to us
        changeAddress: "<paste your address here>"
    });

}
```

now that we have a `Tx` we are just two steps away from it to be registered on-chain:

- sign it
- submit it

### sign the deploy transaciton

to sign a transaciton you'll need the private key of your address.

depending on your environment then there are two ways to sign it:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Browser" label="Browser" default>

In the browser we can use the [CIP-0030](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0030#apisigntxtx-cbortransaction-partialsign-bool--false-promisecbortransaction_witness_set)
standard to sign the transaction.

the standard wants us to pass the CBOR of the transaction encoded as hex string.

that is not a problem because we can get it as follows:
```ts
tx.toCbor().toString()
```

it then returns a new CBOR encoded as hex string which represents the signature.

we can add the signature to our transaction as follows:
```ts
tx.addVKeyWitness(
    VKeyWitness.fromCbor(
        "<CIP-0030 'signTx' result here>"
    )
)
```

so all together becomes

```ts
async function signWithBrowser( tx: Tx, cip30wallet: any ): void
{
    tx.addVKeyWitness(
        VKeyWitness.fromCbor(
            await cip30wallet.signTx(
                tx.toCbor().toString()
            )
        )
    );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="NodeJS / Server" label="NodeJS / Server">

If we are in a server environmet is very likely we have our private key stored in some file.

so we can just read the private key from there, all we need is just an hex string of length 64 after all.
```ts
const privateKey = new PrivateKey( await fs.readFile("path/to/private.key") );
```

we can then use the private key to sign the transaction, `plu-ts` handles the cryptography

```ts
tx.signWith( privateKey )
```

and that's it

now we just put all together
```ts
async function signWithServer( tx: Tx ): void
{
    tx.signWith(
        new PrivateKey( await fs.readFile("path/to/private.key") )
    );
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### submit the deploy transaciton

now we can finally deploy the smart contract all we need to do is just call the koios endpoint

```ts title="src/index.ts"
/* onther imports */
import { koios } from "./offchain/koios"

/* ... */

async main()
{
    let tx = await getDeployAndFoundTx( script );
    await signTxServer( tx );
    await koios.tx.submit( tx );
}
main();
```

## Using the Contract

The last step is to build a new trasaction that will allow us to spend the founds we sent to the contract.

### get the reference UTxO

Apart for this step the process very similar.

If you remember we deployed our script to an UTxO that is locked forever.

We need that UTxO to interact with the contract.

we could query but we already have all the infos to build it ourselves.

an `UTxO` is composed by a `TxOutRef` and a `TxOut`

the `TxOutRef is just the hash of the `Tx` that generated it and the index in the order of the outputs.

so our `TxOutRef` is:
```ts
const txOutRef = new TxOutRef({
    id: tx.hash,
    index: 0
});
```

and the `TxOut` is the resolved reference, and we know exactly what's on that utxo:
```ts
const txOut = new TxOut({
    address: scriptTestnetAddr,
    value: Value.lovelaces( 10_000_000 ),
    refScript: script
});
```

so our reference utxo is
```ts
const myRefUtxo = new UTxO({
    utxoRef: txOutRef,
    resolved: txOut
});
```

### build the transaction

with that utxo reference we can build our tranasction

```ts title="src/offchain/getSpendPoliteTx.ts"
import { Address, PaymentCredentials, Value, DataB, isData } from "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts"
import { scriptTestnetAddr } from "../contract";
import * as uint8array from "@harmoniclabs/uint8array-utils";
import getTxBuilder from "./getTxBuilder.ts";
import queryMyUtxos from "./queryMyUtxos.ts";


export default async function getSpendPoliteTx( myRefUtxo: UTxO, prevTxHash: Hash32 ): Promise<Tx>
{
    const txBuilder = await getTxBuilder();
    const myUTxOs = await queryMyUtxos();

    // find the other utxo of the previous tx
    const utxoToSpend = (await getAddressUtxos( scriptTestnetAddr ))
        .find( utxo => isData( utxo.datum ) );

    if( utxoToSpend === undefined )
    {
        throw "uopsie, are you sure your tx had enough time to get to the blockchain?"
    }

    return txBuilder.buildSync({
        inputs: [
            {
                utxo: utxoToSpend,
                // we must include the utxo that holds our script
                referenceScriptV2: {
                    refUtxo: myRefUtxo,
                    datum: "inline", // the datum is present already on `utxoToSpend`
                    redeemer: new DataB( uint8array.fromAscii("Hello plu-ts") ) // be polite
                }
            }
        ],
        // make sure to include collateral when using contracts
        collaterals: [ myUTxOs[0] ],
        // send everything back to us
        changeAddress: "<paste your address here>"
    });
}
```

### sign and submit

We can re use the fuctions defined above for both signing and submission.

so all we need to do now is really just put everything together

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { script, scriptTestnetAddr } from "./contract";
import { koios } from "./offchain/koios";

/* ... */

async main()
{
    let tx = await getDeployAndFoundTx( script );
    await signTxServer( tx );
    await koios.tx.submit( tx );

    // highlight-start
    console.log( "waiting for tx '" + tx.hash.toString() + "' to be on-chain...")
    await koios.tx.waitConfirmed( tx );

    const myRefUtxo = new UTxO({
        utxoRef: new TxOutRef({
            id: tx.hash,
            index: 0
        }),
        resolved: new TxOut({
            address: scriptTestnetAddr,
            value: Value.lovelaces( 10_000_000 ),
            refScript: script
        })
    });

    tx = await getSpendPoliteTx( myRefUtxo )
    await signTxServer( tx );
    await koios.tx.submit( tx );

    console.log( "waiting for tx '" + tx.hash.toString() + "' to be on-chain...\n\n")
    await koios.tx.waitConfirmed( tx );

    console.log(
        `Unlocked ${tx.body.inputs[0].value.lovelaces / BigInt(1_000_00)} tADA ` +
        `from ${scriptTestnetAddr.toString()}!\n\n` +
        `Check the transaction on Cardanoscan: https://preview.cardanoscan.io/transaction/${tx.hash.toString()}?tab=contracts`
    )
    // highlight-end
}
main();
```

If everything whent trough correctly running the program wiht `npm run start` should now show something like:

```
Unlocked 10 tADA from addr_test1vabcd... !

Check the transaction on Cardanoscan: https://preview.cardanoscan.io/transaction/beefcaffee...?tab=contracts
```
